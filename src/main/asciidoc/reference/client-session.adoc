= MongoDB Sessions

As of version 3.6 MongoDB supports a concept of Sessions. The use of sessions enables MongoDBs https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#causal-consistency[Causal Consistency] model guaranteeing to execute operations in an order that respect their causal relationships. Those are split into ``ServerSession``s and ``ClientSession``s. In the following when we speak of session we refer to `ClientSession`.

WARNING: Operations within a client session are not isolated from operations outside the session.

Both `MongoOperations` and `ReactiveMongoOperations` provide gateway methods for tying a `ClientSession` to the operations themselves. Within the callback all operations on `MongoCollection` and `MongoDatabase` are called with the provided session via a `Proxy` without the need to add it manually. This means that a potential call to `MongoCollection#find()` is delegated to `MongoCollection#find(ClientSession)`.

NOTE: Methods like `(Reactive)MongoOperations#getCollection` returning native MongoDB java driver gateway objects, such as `MongoCollection`, that themselves offer dedicated methods for `ClientSession` will *NOT* be wrapped by the `Proxy`. So please make sure to provide the `ClientSession` where needed when interacting directly with a `MongoCollection` or `MongoDatabase` and not via one of the `#excute` callbacks on `MongoOperations`.

    .build();

ClientSession session = client.startSession(sessionOptions); <1>

template.withSession(() -> session)
    .execute(action -> {

        Query query = query(where("name").is("Durzo Blint"));
        Person durzo = action.findOne(query, Person.class);  <2>

        Person azoth = new Person("Kylar Stern");
        azoth.setMaster(durzo);

        action.insert(azoth);                                <2>

        return azoth;
    });

session.close()                                              <4>
----
<1> Obtain a new session from the server.
<2> Use `MongoOperation` methods as before. The `ClientSession` gets applied automatically.
<3> Important! Do not forget to close the session.

WARNING: When dealing with ``DBRef``s, especially lazily loaded ones, it is essential to **not** close the `ClientSession` before all data is loaded.

The reactive counterpart uses the very same building blocks as the imperative one.

----
<1> Obtain a `Publisher` for new session retrieval.
<2> Use `MongoOperation` methods as before. The `ClientSession` is obtained and applied automatically.
<3> Important! Do not forget to close the session.

By using a `Publisher` providing the actual session you can defer session acquisition to the point of actual subscription.
Still you need to close the session when done in order to not pollute the server with stale sessions. Use the `doFinally` hook on `execute` to call `ClientSession#close()` when you don't need the session any more.
In case you prefer having more control over the session itself, you can always obtain the `ClientSession` via the driver and provide it via a `Supplier`.
