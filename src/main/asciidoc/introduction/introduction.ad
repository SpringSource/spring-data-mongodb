This document is the reference guide for Spring Data - Document Support. It explains Document module concepts and semantics and the syntax for various stores namespaces. 

This section provides some basic introduction to Spring and Document database. The rest of the document refers only to Spring Data Document features and assumes the user is familiar with document databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB as well as Spring concepts.

== Knowing Spring

Spring Data uses Spring framework's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/spring-core.html[core] functionality, such as the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html[IoC] container, http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html#core-convert[type conversion system], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[expression language], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jmx.html[JMX integration], and portable http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/dao.html#dao-exceptions[DAO exception hierarchy]. While it is not important to know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar for whatever IoC container you choose to use.

The core functionality of the MongoDB and CouchDB support can be used directly, with no need to invoke the IoC services of the Spring Container. This is much like `JdbcTemplate` which can be used 'standalone' without any other services of the Spring container. To leverage all the features of Spring Data document, such as the repository support, you will need to configure some parts of the library using Spring.

To learn more about Spring, you can refer to the comprehensive (and sometimes disarming) documentation that explains in detail the Spring Framework. There are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on the matter - take a look at the Spring framework http://spring.io/docs[home page ] for more information.

== Knowing NoSQL and Document databases

NoSQL stores have taken the storage world by storm. It is a vast domain with a plethora of solutions, terms and patterns (to make things worth even the term itself has multiple http://www.google.com/search?q=nosoql+acronym[meanings]). While some of the principles are common, it is crucial that the user is familiar to some degree with the stores supported by DATADOC. The best way to get acquainted to this solutions is to read their documentation and follow their examples - it usually doesn't take more then 5-10 minutes to go through them and if you are coming from an RDMBS-only background many times these exercises can be an eye opener.

The jumping off ground for learning about MongoDB is http://www.mongodb.org/[www.mongodb.org]. Here is a list of other useful resources.

* The http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/[manual] introduces MongoDB and contains links to getting started guides, reference documentation and tutorials.
* The http://try.mongodb.org/[online shell] provides a convenient way to interact with a MongoDB instance in combination with the online http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/[tutorial.]
* MongoDB http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/[Java Language Center]
* Several http://www.mongodb.org/books[books] available for purchase
* Karl Seguin's online book: "http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf[The Little MongoDB Book]"
